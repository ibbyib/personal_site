			Pursuing my web design dream. I hope to one day learn all that there is to know about the ever-growing HTML5 and CSS scripts, and hopefully even Javascript.
		</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I enjoy playing video games, writing code, watching movies, t.v.shows, and Youtube videos. I would love to learn more about code than I already do, as my current knowledge is limited to basically html5 and css3.</p>

		<h2>My Design</h2>
		<p>So, as you may already be able to see by the style of my site, I specialize in  minimalist designs. Minimalist designs are sort of modern, abstract designs. If you've ever heard the saying "Less is more", well that is basically what minimalist design is. You can read more about it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">this Wikipedia page.</a></p>

		<h2>What I would Like to Do</h2>
		<p>I would love to work for a company at some point in my life. Any company, just so long as I have fun and I am productive. I would also like to try working at home sometime. Could be a nice experience! Also, game design is a really interesting thing for me as well.</p>

		<h2>Currently Looking For Work</h2>
		<p>Yes, that's right. I am looking for work. I would like to do some cheap work, nothing over $30, to hone my skills and add things to my portfolio. Please contact me at one of the e-mails on the 'contact' page or at the e-mail below and I'll get back to you A.S.A.P.. </p>
		<h2>Additional Info</h2>
		<p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:dylandxndesign@gmail.com">dylan@thepicrain.com</a>, and you can check out my current website at <a href="http://thepicrain.com/">http://thepicrain.com/</a>. Thank you for checking out my beginner's website!</p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/ibbyib/personalsite"><button class="primary">Change This Website!</button></a><br/>Yes, that's right. I'm offering up this website to anyone who wants to work on it or improve it in any way, shape, or form. Just go to the github, download the html and css, and change it around! Please let me know if you found something cool or something that I may want to see! Go ahead! I don't mind!</p>
